                You'll find a calendar on clicking the respective button.<br>
            You can click on any date you want, and a pop-up text box will appear <br>
        by which you can write anything without worrying about the word limit.<br>
        For example, a diary entry about how you day went, or to simply vent your emotions. <br>
    Now by placing your cursor on that specific date after entering the data,<br>
    you can view it on the entire page. You can always edit and delete the entries anytime.<br>
Note  that the screen for the entered data only appears while your cursor is on this webpage.<br>
The screen automatically hides when you move your cursor outside the live page.</h4>
                  <li>Important Dates</li>
                  <h4> 
                    You'll find a calendar with tabular columns with an option to add events to that specific date. <br>
                    While entering the event in the text box, you can hit "add event." which will directly add<br>
                    your event to that current day. Or you can type the event and click on the date to which you <br>
                    want that event to be displayed so that it'll be beside that particular date. The dates can<br>
                    include the birthday of your loved ones or anniversaries. It can also be your exam date, <br>
                    result date, or anything as you wish. <br>   </h4>
